# Medicine-Recommendation-System
The Medicine Recommendation System is an intelligent healthcare support application developed using Python and Streamlit. It leverages machine learning, specifically a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), to predict diseases based on the symptoms provided by the user. The user interacts with a simple web interface where they can select symptoms from a comprehensive list. These symptoms are converted into a binary vector format and passed into the trained model to predict the most probable disease. Once a prediction is made, the system fetches additional information from various datasets to recommend relevant medications, dietary plans, precautions, and suitable workouts for the predicted condition. This project aims to assist individuals in understanding their health conditions early and provides supportive care suggestions even in the absence of immediate medical help. It is especially useful in remote areas or for preliminary health analysis. The application is user-friendly, informative, and promotes health awareness through data-driven insights, making it a valuable tool in the healthcare domain.
